    <p>This recipe is easily one of my wife's and I favorite recipes.
        Its super quick and easy and tastes great with tons of room to expeiriment and add! On top of that it is jam packed with flavor
        and leaves room for healthier substitutions via subbing different proteins. And better yet this meal is quick to cook
        and only requires minimal dishes! <strong><em>SCORE!</em></strong> Right, enough chit chat, lets get cookin'!</p>
